<h1> Tags </h1> 
<p> Hey, this is a mockup paragraph tag</p>
<p> Opening tags start with &lt;tag&gt; and end with &lt;/tag&gt; </p>

<article>
    <h1> THIS IS AN ARTICLE </h1> 

    Hi this is an article tag! <br> 

    Basically we can add lots of content here. <br> 

    This doesn't really look any different to paragraph tags to be honest but 
    I'm sure we can add styling here <br> 

    <em> I can even make this text italacized </em> <br>

    <h2> I can even make this text bigger here</h2>

<p> 
    Lots of html is nested, it is a tree object by nature <br>
    HTML renders into a DOM tree - Document object Model.
